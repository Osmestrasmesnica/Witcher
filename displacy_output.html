 thought he would leave <br>without a word, without a parting gesture, but the king stopped and looked at him. <br><br>'You inspire trust,' he said, 'although I know what a rogue you are.

 did not reply. <br><br>'Because I think,' said the king, 'I think that she is suffering. Am I not right?' <br><br>The witcher fixed his penetrating eyes on the king. He didn't confirm it, didn't nod, didn't <br>make the slightest gesture, but

, the town had cut itself off from this <br>dangerous place, leaving nothing but a few ruins, rotten beams and the remains of a gap-<br>toothed palisade which had obviously not been worth dismantling and moving. As far away as <br>possible - at the opposite end of the settlement - the king had built his new residence. The <br>stout tower of his new palace loomed black in the distance, against the darkening blue of the <br>sky. <br><br><br>In

 of the empty, plundered chambers, the witcher returned to the dusty table at which he <br>was preparing, calmly and meticulously. He knew he had plenty of time. The striga would not <br>leave her crypt before

. <br><br>On the table in front of him he had a small chest with metal fittings. He opened it. Inside, <br>packed tightly in compartments lined with dried grass, stood small vials of dark glass. The <br>witcher removed

. <br><br>From the floor, he picked up an oblong packet thickly wrapped <br><br>in sheep's skins and fastened with a leather strap. He unwrapped it and pulled out a sword <br>with an elaborate hilt, in a black, shiny scabbard covered with rows of runic signs and <br>symbols. He drew the blade, which lit up with a pure shine of mirror-like brightness. It was <br>pure silver. <br><br>

 vials, <br>placing his left hand on the blade of the sword after each sip. Then, wrapping himself tightly <br>in his black coat, he sat down on the floor. There were no chairs in the chamber, or in the rest <br>of the palace. <br><br>He sat motionless, his eyes closed. His breathing, at

 even, suddenly quickened, became <br>rasping and tense. And then stopped completely. The mixture which helped the witcher gain <br>full control of his body was chiefly made up of veratrum, stramonium, hawthorn and spurge. <br>The other ingredients had no name in any human language.

, inured to it from childhood, it would have been lethal poison. <br><br>The witcher turned his head abruptly. In the silence his hearing, sharpened beyond measure, <br>easily picked out a rustle of footsteps through the courtyard overgrown with stinging nettles. <br>It could not be the striga. The steps were too light.

, backed away abruptly; an involuntary grimace of terror and repulsion <br>contorted his lips. The witcher smiled wryly - he knew what he looked like. After drinking a <br>mixture of banewart, monk's hood and eyebright the face takes on the colour of chalk, and the <br>pupils fill the entire
